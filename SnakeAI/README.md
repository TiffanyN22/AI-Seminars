# Snake AI
## About
This program is a bot for a modified game of Snake that will generate a map with random obstacles, use the breadth-first search algorithm to find a path from the food to the snake's head, update the screen as the snake moves towards the food and grows until it reaches its target length or there is no path for it to reach the food, and includes an option for the user to see a visualization of the bfs algorithm and/or path generation.

### Color Meaning:
- Black: Obstacles
- Bright Green: Snake's Head
- Darker Green: Snake's Body
- Red: Food that the snake is trying to get to
- Pink: current cell being checked in bfs visualizaiton
- Light Pink: current neighbor cell being checked in bfs visualization
- Cyan: Path Visualization
